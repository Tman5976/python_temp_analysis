# Surfs_up Challenge

## Purpose

In this challenge, we prepared weather data for our client who is thinking of opening a surf shop on Oahu. We used a database that collected data from the Oahu between the years 2010-2017. Our job was to find the summary statistcs from the months of June and December so we can present them to the client.

## Results

The June and December summary statistics tables shown below provide an insight into the expected temperatures of Oahu for those months.

- The mean temperature for June is 74.9 degrees. The mean in December is 71 degrees. We can conclude average monthly temperatures on Oahu will follow the data for the other months.
It is reasonable to assume average temperatures will remain consistent because June and December are six months apart. It is unlikely temperatures will have a significant variance between those months if the delta of the average temperatures for June and December is 3.9 degrees.

- June's temperatures do not exhibit much deviation from the mean. The table shows that the standard deviation is 3.25 degrees. The lowest recorded temperature in June was 64 degrees, and the highest was 85 degrees. With a 21 degree difference in high to low temperatures i

- December has a similar difference in recorded temperatures. The recorded high was 83 degrees with a low of 71 degrees. December's degree difference is 22 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.75 degrees.

## Summary

This data describes a consistent picture of the weather on Oahu. The difference in high to low temperatures from June and December is only one degree, and the standard deviation difference is 0.5 degrees. The surf shop our client is looking to open should not have any concerns about the temperature affecting people's ability to surf on Oahu.

Finding two more queries to run on our weather data could be started by running the following code.

This code will give us the following output.


The precipitation on Oahu during June and December would provide vital information about the viability of a surf shop. If there is too much rain on Oahu, people are most likely going to avoid surfing.

The second query I would suggest cannot be found from the database, but finding statistics on Oahu's wind speeds would also be critical. Winds may impact how likely people are to surf, and the surf shop could be faced with trouble if the winds on Oahu hinder surfing.
